Pre-corrected FFT for MATLAB
Release notes

Version 1.3
- Hankel-like functions capability. 
- Vector potential compatibility.
- Parallel toolbox parfor compatibility.

Version 1.2
- Direct stencil is now a square.
- Reciprocity is utilized extensively in the precorrection calculation. 
  Precorrection projection is restricted to the forward half, and the 
  reverse half is simply mirrored. 
- Bug fixes and further vectorization in the precorrection loop.
- Addition of a "verbose mode" which gives feedback on setup times.

Still to come:
- Extend pfft.pmat() to projecting quadrature, weights and excitations.
- Hankel-like function capability
- Double layer compatibility.
